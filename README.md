This project is a full-stack application that displays information about Game of Thrones characters. It consists of a Node.js backend that fetches data from a MongoDB Atlas database and a React frontend that displays this data. The project is containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes. The CI/CD pipeline is managed with Jenkins, and the infrastructure is defined using Terraform. Monitoring is handled by Prometheus and Grafana.
