Title: Movie Ranking Web Application using AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes

Objective: Develop and deploy a movie ranking web application on AWS, leveraging Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. Automate infrastructure setup and deployment processes using Terraform and implement CI/CD using Jenkins.

Technologies used:

Backend: Node.js or Python for server-side development.
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing movie data and user ratings.
Frontend: React or Angular for building dynamic user interfaces.
CI/CD: Jenkins for automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform for provisioning and managing AWS resources.
Cloud Provider: AWS (Amazon Web Services) for scalable cloud infrastructure.
Containerization: Docker for packaging the application and its dependencies into containers.
Orchestration: Kubernetes for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring application performance, container metrics, and infrastructure health.
Achievements:

Developed a responsive and user-friendly movie ranking web application using AWS services.
Utilized Docker for containerization to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.
Orchestrated application deployment and scaling efficiently with Kubernetes, enhancing scalability and reliability.
Implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins to automate testing, build, and deployment processes.
Integrated Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and visualization, ensuring optimal performance and availability of the application.
